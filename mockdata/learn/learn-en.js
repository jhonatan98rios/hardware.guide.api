      description: `The processor or CPU (central processing unit) is the component that carries out the instructions of a program based on a logical, arithmetic and data input and output system. The processor can be compared to the role of the brain in the human body. The processor has some basic properties that must be observed. The number of nuclei is the number of independent central processing units. Some processors may still have threads that are virtual units, that is, simulated and that can add performance. The clock is the frequency with which a processor's transistors open and close. Higher frequencies usually mean faster processing speed. The frequency is measured in gigahertz (GHz), or billions of cycles per second. The cache is a processor's quick access memory. Lithography refers to the size of the semiconductor that is used to manufacture an integrated circuit and is expressed in nanometers. The smaller the lithography, the more modern the technology used. The socket is the communication interface between the processor and the motherboard. Some processors even feature integrated video, that is, it contains a part of the chip dedicated to performing graphics processing.`

      description: `The motherboard is the component that gathers and communicates all the components of a computer system. In addition to allowing information traffic, the card also feeds some peripherals with the electrical energy it receives from the cabinet source. The properties of the motherboard are: Chipset, which is a chip embedded in the board that gathers all the information that will allow it to work together with the other components and peripherals. Socket is the communication interface between the CPU and the motherboard. Each generation of cards and processors will feature a socket. Modern cards feature built-in features, such as dual bios for recursion, network input, audio and video input and output (depend on GPU integrated in the CPU)`

      description: `RAM is responsible for speeding up the system. Basically, RAM temporarily stores all the information that the computer is using, be it open software and files, music and videos being played and games running. This is a factor that sets it apart from an HD, for example, which is slower and makes for long-term storage. The memory is volatile, that is, it only stores information while energized (turned on). Every time the PC is turned off, this memory is erased.`

      description: `The HD or Hard Disk is used to store files, programs, games and all kinds of content that you want to keep on your computer. The component is another type of memory that exists inside a PC, similar to RAM memory, but unlike it, it can keep the content on file even after the computer is turned off, that is, it is not volatile. In addition to traditional hard drives, there are also SSD or Solid-State Drive which are the newest storage technology available. Unlike HD, the SSD has no moving parts and is therefore much faster to load, read and save files. It is also much more resistant to damage because it has no mechanical parts. The main advantage of the SSD is its speed. Since the SSD places all files in flash memory modules, access is incredibly much faster.`

This part is also known as a graphics processing unit (or GPU) and can be integrated, which are part of the processor, or dedicated, larger and more powerful cards. GPUs are also widely used in applications that require parallel processing, such as cryptocurrency mining, machine learning, and supercomputing.`

      description: `It is a program or set of programs whose function is to manage system resources and provide an interface between the hardware and the user. It works as a translator between the electronic components and the user's actions through the input and output devices (keyboard, mouse, monitor, speaker). The OS also offers a series of APIs that allow software developers to communicate their programs to the machine's native resources, such as files, network, camera and other peripherals. The most popular Operating Systems today are Windows 10 (from Microsoft), Mac OS (from Apple) and Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu and Android.`

      description: `A HD has mobile disks, used to store data, and a mechanical arm, which reads and writes. The speed normally varies between 5,400 and 7,200 RPMs (Rotations Per Minute). The price per MB is your main advantage over the SSD. An SSD stores data in Flash memory cells, the same as in smartphones and tablets. The main difference between HD and SSD is that the second is faster and safer, as it does not contain moving parts.`

      description: `Every computer needs a cooling system to dissipate the heat produced during the thousands of data exchanges that take place while the machine is on and performing functions. So that your computer does not overheat, the Cooler is the part responsible for cooling the processor and some components such as the motherboard so that the internal temperature remains at safe levels. In common among all coolers is the presence of fans, a type of fan that, with some differences depending on the type of cooler, serves to move the heat produced and dissipate it. All computers and notebooks are shipped from the factory with a cooling system, the majority of which are made up of two fans.`

      description: `Monitor is the video output peripheral, that is, the component responsible for displaying the images rendered by the video card. There are numerous types of monitors, which can vary in size, features (speakers, phone output, touch screen, etc.), resolution (image definition) and technology from which the panel is made. The resolution is measured by the amount of color dots present on the panel (pixels). The panel is formed by a mesh of pixels that can have different sizes, such as 1240 wide, 720 high (known as HD), 1920 by 1080 (Full HD) 2560 x 1440 (4k), among others. The resolution is often related to the size of the monitor but there are models that are outside the rule. There are 24-inch monitors with resolutions ranging from Full HD to 4K resolution. TN panels are the most common type of panel on the market, being the most used in the simplest and cheapest monitors, but they also have a low response time (delay between the entry of information and the display). VA panels have the ability to reproduce vivid colors and the highest levels of contrast. Such details result in excellent images when playing videos and images. IPS monitors have high fidelity in color reproduction. In addition to this advantage, these screens have the best contrast settings. However, the reproduction of black levels is generally lower than what we see on VA-type panels.`
